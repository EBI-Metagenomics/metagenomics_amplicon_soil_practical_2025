    "text": "Learning Objectives\n\nEvaluate the quality of metagenomic sequencing data using appropriate metrics and tools.\nIdentify the taxa present in the sample and visualise them in a Krona plot.\nApply Kraken2, KrakenTools, and Bracken to perform taxonomic classification of metagenomic data.\nCalculate and interpret alpha diversity metrics from metagenomic samples using the above tools to gain ecological insights.\n\n\n\n\nSet up your Galaxy account and workspace\n\n Steps:\n\nNavigate to: Galaxy\nIn the upper right corner click on “Register” and go through the steps (skip if you already have an account).\nImportant: make sure you activate your account by clicking the link Galaxy will send to your email address.\nCreate and name your Galaxy history:\n\nFind the history panel on the right-hand side and click on the “+” to create a new history (its default name will be “Unnamed history”)\n\n\n\nClick on the name and change it to “Metagenomics practical”. It should look like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload data\n In today’s practical, we will be working with two samples from tomato rhizosphere: SRR15517665 and SRR15517666. We will start by taking a look at just one FASTQ file to assess its quality. In real life, you would do this for all four files (there are two FASTQ files per sample since this is paired-end sequencing).\n\n\n Steps:\n\nLocate and click on the Upload button in Galaxy (upper left corner of the page):\n\n\nA window will pop up. Click on the “Paste/fetch data” (shown in the image below):\n\n\nPaste the following link in the window and click Start: ftp://ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/SRR155/065/SRR15517665/SRR15517665_1.fastq.gz\n\nThe pop-up window will turn green, and you can now close it.\nThe upload will take a few minutes. While the data are uploading, you will see the process in your history appear in orange and with a spinning wheel. This will be the case for all processes that are in progress in today’s practical. When processes complete, they turn green.\n\n\nWhen the upload is complete and the process has turned green, you can click on it and see your data preview:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck data quality\n Before we proceed with the analysis, we should check that the data quality is OK. Normally, we would do this for all FASTQ files but for the purposes of this exercise we will try with one. We will be using FastQC.\n\n Steps:\n\nClick on the “Tools” icon on the left-hand side, locate FastQC (or search for it in the search window that will appear) and click on it.\n\nWe will only be specifying one parameter: “Raw read data from your current history”. Select the FASTQ file we just downloaded and click the blue “Run Tool” button:\n\n\nFastQC should now be running (you should see it in orange in your history menu on the right). Because it takes a while to run on such a large file, we will proceed to other steps now and come back to look at the results later.\nNote the step number in Galaxy history to easily come back to it when it’s done.\n\n\n\n\n\nWho is in my sample?\n Let’s now find out what taxa we have in these two samples. We will be using Kraken2.\nBecause of how large the files are (this is the reality of metagenomics, especially soil/rhisozphere), we already ran Kraken2 for you. You will be working with the outputs of these runs.\n\nThis is the command that was used on each of the two samples (using SRR15517665 as the example here):\n\nkraken2 --paired --gzip-compressed --threads 32 --db  Standard \\\n--report SRR15517665_standard_report.txt --output SRR15517665_standard.out \\\nFastq/SRR15517665_1.fastq.gz Fastq/SRR15517665_2.fastq.gz\nHere is what the different parameters mean:\n--paired: specifies that we have paired FASTQ files (forward and reverse reads)\n--gzip-compressed: specifies that our FASTQ files are gzip compressed\n--threads 32: tells Kraken2 to use 32 threads (for faster processing)\n--db  Standard: specifies the database to use. Here, we are using Kraken2’s Standard database.\n--report: tells Kraken2 to produce a report file and specifies the file name for it. We will be using this report in the upcoming steps.\n--output: specifies where to save the output to\nFastq/SRR15517665_1.fastq.gz Fastq/SRR15517665_2.fastq.gz: these are paths to the paired-end FASTQ files.\n\nWe also ran this command again using a different Kraken2 database - PlusPF-8 (this is the standard database + protozoa and fungi, capped at 8GB)\n\n\n Steps to load the Kraken2 results into Galaxy:\n\n\nClick on the “Upload” icon in the top left corner in Galaxy, then on “Paste/fetch data”\n\nPaste the following links into the window:\n\n\nhttps://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/metagenomics/temp/Plant_breeding_course_2025/Kraken_results/SRR15517665_standard.out\nhttps://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/metagenomics/temp/Plant_breeding_course_2025/Kraken_results/SRR15517665_standard_report.txt\nhttps://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/metagenomics/temp/Plant_breeding_course_2025/Kraken_results/SRR15517666_standard.out\nhttps://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/metagenomics/temp/Plant_breeding_course_2025/Kraken_results/SRR15517666_standard_report.txt\nhttps://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/metagenomics/temp/Plant_breeding_course_2025/Kraken_results/SRR15517666_PlusPF-8_report.txt\nhttps://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/metagenomics/temp/Plant_breeding_course_2025/Kraken_results/SRR15517665_PlusPF-8_report.txt\nPress Start, the window should turn green and you can close it.\n\n\n\n\n\nData quality - check the results\nWhile the Kraken2 results are loading, let’s check the outputs of FastQC, which should now be ready.\n In the history panel on the right-hand side locate the FastQC output. It should be called FastQC on dataset [number]: Web page. Click on the eye icon to view it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\n\nHow many sequences are there in total in this FASTQ file?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n30,972,510 (You can get this number from the “Basic Statistics” table\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\n\nScroll through the results and examine the plots (you can download them to make this easier). Did any of the steps not pass quality control? Can you think why that might be?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nThe GC-content plot “failed”. However, the theoretical, normal distribution is built with the expectation that the sequencing data comes from a single genome. Because this is a metagenomic sample and it contains a mix of different species each with its own GC content, the distribution does not follow the curve expected for a single species. In other words, this is expected in this case.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWho is in my sample? - continued\nNow that we know that our sample is good quality, we can proceed with analysis. We will start by making four Krona plots (two per sample - one for the standard database and one for the PlusPF-8 database).\n\n\n Steps\n\n\nSearch for Krakentools: Convert kraken report file to krona text file in the list of tools on the left-hand side of the page in Galaxy.\n\nKick off Krona plot input generation for the four Kraken report files (see the screenshot - you can choose multiple input files if you click the “Multiple datasets” icon:\n\nClicking the “Run Tool” button will start four Krona plot input generation jobs, wait for them to finish.\n\nTake the time to rename the outputs of Step 2 so that you keep track of samples:\n\nGo through the four results named similarly to “Krakentools: Convert kraken report file on dataset 36”, one at a time by clicking on the pencil icon (“Edit attributes”)\n\nClick on the “Details” tab to check which Kraken2 report file was used as input\n\nThen click the “Edit” tab, and add the information to the “Name” field (record both the sample name and the Kraken2 db that was used - Standard or PlusPF-8\n\nClick “Save”.\n\n\nMake the Krona plots: search for Krona pie chart from taxonomic profile in the tool panel.\nSelect “Tabular” in the “What is the type of your input data” field. As your inputs, select the four files you just renamed in Step 3:\n\nClick “Run Tool”\n\nYou will get 4 Krona plots as your output. Remove the noisy labels next to the Krona plot by clicking on the “X” icon just above them (located to the right of the Krona plot).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\n\nFor each run (SRR15517665 and SRR15517666) compare how the Krona plots look for the Standard database and for the PlusPF-8 database. Are there any differences?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\n\nNow compare the two samples to each other (make sure you are comparing the results obtained using the same database). What can you say about their relative taxonomic composition?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCalculating alpha diversity\n Alpha diversity describes how diverse a single sample is. It summarizes how many taxa are present (a metric called richness) and how evenly they are distributed within that one sample. In other words, it answers the question “How complex is this community?”\n\nWe can compute diversity metrics from the Kraken2 outputs but we first need to process them with a tool called Bracken. Bracken fixes a known limitation of Kraken2 by turning classifications into more accurate abundance estimates. Kraken2 classifies each read to the lowest common ancestor (LCA) in the taxonomy. It is optimised for speed and classification, not abundance. If a read matches multiple closely related species, Kraken2 assigns it higher up (genus, family, etc.) leading to inflated counts of higher taxonomic levels.\nBracken uses k-mer distribution information from the Kraken2 database to reassign reads downward to species (or genus, etc.). It estimated read counts and relative abundances and answers the question “Given these ambiguous classifications, what is the most likely true abundance?”\n\nFor this exercise, we will only use Kraken2 outputs computed using the Standard database to save time. We will be computing the Shannon diversity index, which will give us a single number summarising species richness and evenness in a sample.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\n\nGiven the Krona plots you just examined, how different do you expect alpha diversity to be between the two samples in your analysis?\n\n\n\n Steps to run Bracken\n\nSearch for Bracken in the list of tools.\nIn the Kraken report file field, click the Multiple datasets icon to enable selection of several reports. Choose files SRR15517665_standard_report.txt and SRR15517666_standard_report.txt as inputs from the drop down list.\nIn the Select a Kmer distribution field, choose Standard (this was the Kraken2 database used to generate these reports).\nLeave the remaining parameters unchanged and click Run Tool\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask\n\n\n\nExamine Bracken outputs - did any read counts get reassigned?\n\n\n\n\n Steps to calculate alpha diversity for the two samples\n\nSearch for Krakentools: Calculates alpha diversity in the Tools list\nClick the Multiple datasets icon and select the two Bracken reports as inputs.\nLeave the remaining parameters unchanged and click Run Tool\n\nYou will receive a Shannon index value for each sample.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\n\nWhat values for Shannon diversity index did you get? How different are they between the two samples? Is this what you expected?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\n\nDo you remember from the lecture what the Shannon diversity index values you got might mean?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReuseApache 2.0",

    "text": "Quality assessment with FastQC\nAssessing datasets quality is an essential step if we aim to obtain a meaningful downstream analysis. We can do this by looking at the raw sequence, which is usually stored in a FASTQ file. The FASTQ format is a text-based format that contains the raw sequence returned by the sequencer, and quality values associated to every base pair.\nFastQC is tool allowing you to observe sequence quality and content quickly.\nLook up FastQC in the list of tools on the top right corner, and launch it on the sequences that you uploaded.\nFastQC returns two types of outputs: a raw file and a pre-made html file containing multiple graphs with information about the sequence. Download that file, extract it, and open it in your browser of preference. FastQC provides information on various parameters, such as the range of quality values across all bases at each position.\nThe first section of a FastQC report is a summary for all quality checkes tested by the tool.\n\n\n\nFastQC summary\n\n\nIt looks like not all the checks passed, let’s look at a few of these more in detail.\n\n\n\nFastQC base quality\n\n\nFor each position, a BoxWhisker-type plot is drawn:\n\nThe central red line is the median value.\nThe yellow box represents the inter-quartile range (25-75%).\nThe upper and lower whiskers represent the 10% and 90% points.\nThe blue line represents the mean quality.\n\nThe y-axis on the graph shows the quality scores. The higher the score, the better the base call. The background of the graph divides the y-axis into very good quality calls (green), calls of reasonable quality (orange), and calls of poor quality (red).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\n\nLooking at the plot above, what does the quality of the sample look like?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nThe majority of the base sequence quality values falls into the good-quality section of the graph, and only the lower side of the whiskers is sometimes falling in the red region.\n\n\n\nYou can also look up the distribution of the average quality per read in the sample:\n\n\n\nFastQC sequence quality\n\n\nYou can observe how the distribution of amplicon bases is much more scattered compared to a metagenomic samples. This is usually because amplicon sequencing targets specific regions, leading to a higher chance of the same base position containing the same base.\n\n\n\nFastQC base content\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\n\nThe DNA composition looks very even until nucleotide ~10, and after that, there are distinct differences. Why do you think that is?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first bases in this sample are primer sequence. In amplicon libraries, all reads start at (nearly) the same position because PCR primers define the amplicon boundaries. This means that the same primer sequence (or its reverse complement) is present at the start of almost every read, leading to a highly uniform per-base sequence content. After nucleotide ~10, the biological target sequence begins.\n\n\n\nThere are a few other summaries in this report you can look into. You may notice that a few of these summaries are labelled as failed (red cross), but this is not an error for amplicon sequences, as we are mostly targeting repeated sequences, and duplication/GC content expectations differ a lot from what a metagenomic sample would yield.",

    "text": "Performing taxonomic annotation of your amplicon data\nIn the following section we will compare results from two different tools that we will launch on your amplicon data: Kraken2 and MAPseq. You will observe how the choice in tool and reference database can change results drastically.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStepConvert fastq to fasta\n\n\n\nThis step is needed to proceed with downstream analyses. Fasta files are fastq files deprived of their quality values.\nLook up FASTQ to FASTA in the list of tools\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionBeware of pointing to the correct file\n\n\n\nAnalyses names can be a bit confusing in galaxy - to remember which files you are supposed to use in downstream anallyses it is recommended to rename them by pressing the pencil symbol on the analysis, and then editing the Name to something you’ll remember easily.\n\n\n\nMAPseq\nMAPseq provides a fast and accurate sequence read mapping against hierarchically clustered and annotated reference sequences.\nFrom the MAPseq repo:\nMAPseq is a set of fast and accurate sequence read classification tools designed \nto assign taxonomy and OTU classifications to ribosomal RNA sequences. This is \ndone by using a reference set of full-length ribosomal RNA sequences for which \nknown taxonomies are known, and for which a set of high quality OTU clusters \nhas been previously generated. For each read, the best guess and correspoding \nconfidence in the assignment is shown at each taxonomic and OTU level.\nLook up MAPseq in the list of tools, and select the SSU database, as this was the targeted subunit, and default parameters.\nWe ran the sample against LSU and ITS databases, but the yield was very low, as expected.\nAmong the available options, there is the possibility of creating a table suitable for krona plot generation. This will be used later for a visual observation of your dataset.\n\n\nKraken2\nWhile MAPseq is based on seuqence alignment against a reference, Kraken2 is a k-mer based taxonomy annotation tool. This means that every sequence is split in k-mers and searched against a database to identify which taxa matches it the most.\n\nLook up Kraken2 in the list of tools. Keep all parameters set as default set of parameters, with the exception of:\n\nEnable quick operation will make processing faster by only using the best hit.\nSelect a Kraken2 database - use SILVA from 2022 (the most recent SILVA instance on galaxy)\n\nIn a separate session you could try changing these parameters and aim for better accuracy, bearing in mind that execution time might increase.\n\nKraken-report + Krakentools\nA few more steps are required for kraken data to be converted to a format ingestable in a krona plot.\nFirst, select ‘Kraken-report’ from the list of tools, and give it the Kraken classification file as input. The tool will only run for a few seconds. Do the same with ’ Krakentools: Convert kraken report file to krona text file’ by giving it the file ‘Kraken-report’ just generated.\n\n\nKrona pie chart\nUse both tabular files that have been generated by MAPseq and Kraken2 as input files. This tool will generate a separate plot for each dataset.\n\n\n\nKraken2 vs MAPseq comparison\nOpen the two krona plots you just generated. They should look like these two:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMAPseq\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKraken2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\n\nNotice the contamination on MAPseq’s output, and the difference in annotation numbers between the two (to be found in the top-right corner). Thinking about the parameters that we used, do you understand why this was picked up by MAPseq, but not by Kraken2?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nKraken2 was only focused on a bacterial database, while we used a generic SSU database for MAPseq. Also this shows probably how much contamination there was in the initial sample, underlying how important it is to decontaminate your sample beforehand.\n\n\n\nLet’s focus only on the bacterial annotations by clicking on the Bacteria sections of the plots.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\n\nQuite clearly, Kraken2 wasn’t able to pick up as many annotations as MAPseq. You will explore this in more detail in the metagenomics section, but why do you think Kraken2 doesn’t work as well on amplicon, and it’s probably better suited for metagenomics data?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nKraken2 is k-mer–based, and looks for exact matches against the reference. While MAPseq fully aligns sequences, Kraken2 assigns reads based on shared k-mers. This makes Kraken2 very sensitive to conserved regions.\nOn top of this, Firmicutes are known to be a bit too overrepresented in SILVA, and Geobacillus is known to have many near-identical SSU entries. While Kraken2 is a permissive algorithm, MAPseq is very conservative, as it has to deal with highly repetitive sequences. In fact, only ~1-2% of MAPseq’s results are reported to belong to Geobacilli.",
