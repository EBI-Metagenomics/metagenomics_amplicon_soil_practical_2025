### Download data
In today's practical, we will be working with two samples from tomato rhizosphere: [SRR15517665](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/SRR15517665) and [SRR15517666](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/SRR15517666). The data have been manipulated in the following ways:
Start by downloading the FASTQ files to Galaxy.

While the data are downloading, you will see the process in your history appear in orange and with a spinning wheel. This will be the case for all processes that are in progress in today's practical. When processes complete, they turn green.


Run FastQC on one file
Take a look at the FastQC report (Webpage)
